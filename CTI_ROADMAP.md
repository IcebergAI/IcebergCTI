# Iceberg — CTI Tradecraft Advisory Roadmap

> **Type:** Strategic advisory roadmap (assessment + prioritised recommendations). This document is a forward-looking deliverable; the field/model proposals below are illustrative of direction, not an implementation spec.

This has mostly been moved into GitHub issues and Projects, refer there rather than here

## Context

Iceberg is a **finished-intelligence production** platform (collect in notebooks → author narrative reports → review → disseminate), deliberately *not* an IOC/indicator store ("Iceberg doesn't deal directly in IOCs"). This roadmap answers: as a senior threat-intel specialist, how would I evolve it to better align with contemporary CTI best practice?

The guiding principle is **respect that identity**. The highest-leverage moves are *not* to bolt on an indicator repository (that is OpenCTI/MISP territory and would dilute the product). They are to raise the **analytic rigour** of the finished product to professional standards (ICD 203 / structured analytic techniques) and to give the **knowledge layer** the entity/relationship structure modern CTI consumers expect — while keeping reports narrative-first.

This roadmap **prioritises two themes** — *Analytic Tradecraft (ICD 203)* and *Knowledge Graph / Actor Profiles* — and summarises the remaining opportunities as a secondary backlog.

> **Status (2026-06-26).** Priority 1 is shipped, including source grading, estimative language, judgement scaffolding, ACH and the hedging-lint preview warning. Priority 2 shipped as tag aliases and attribution profiles; the earlier in-app entity-relationship graph was removed to keep Iceberg focused on finished-product production rather than becoming a TIP. From the secondary backlog, **A (ATT&CK Navigator export + matrix)**, **B's STIX report export foundation + TAXII serving**, **C's webhook + tag-subscription matching plus preferences UI**, **D (feedback loop)**, **F's audience-group need-to-know foundation plus admin/editor UI**, **G (requirement kinds/PIR coverage)**, **H (maturity dashboard)** and **I's RSS/Atom ingestion foundation plus triage UI** have shipped. AI review UI, richer STIX validation/enrichment, TAXII/MISP pull, and a full ATT&CK import remain follow-ups. PAP is deliberately not planned; see #32.

## Current-state assessment (grounded in the code)

**Strengths — keep and build on:**
- **TLP 2.0 done correctly** — `CLEAR` + `AMBER_STRICT`, restrictiveness-ranked for dissemination gating ([models.py:36-78](src/iceberg/models.py#L36-L78)). Ahead of many platforms.
- **Diamond Model** as a first-class per-notebook analytic artefact: four core features + ordinal confidence pip-meter + labelled meta-axes ([models.py:330-353](src/iceberg/models.py#L330-L353), [services/diamond.py](src/iceberg/services/diamond.py)).
- **Source reliability grading** — Admiralty/NATO-style reliability + credibility chips on notebook sources, report citations, report source lists, and the PDF appendix, with a fully offline heuristic over source identity, summary and pasted source content plus manual override ([services/source_grading.py](src/iceberg/services/source_grading.py)).
- **ATT&CK identifiers** carried on a controlled, admin-curated taxonomy — T-codes (technique), G-codes (actor), S-codes (malware) in `Tag.external_id` ([models.py:468-481](src/iceberg/models.py#L468-L481), [data/starter_tags.json](src/iceberg/data/starter_tags.json)).
- Clean lifecycle, requirement→product traceability, FTS5 + faceted search, multi-format Typst PDFs.

**Gaps that matter for a *finished-intelligence* platform:**
- ~~**No estimative language.**~~ **Addressed (§1b):** reports carry an optional analytic-confidence marking, a standardised probability yardstick and a non-blocking hedging-lint preview warning.
- ~~**Limited structured analytic techniques.**~~ **Addressed (§1c stretch):** alongside Key Judgements / Key Assumptions / Intelligence Gaps, **Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)** now ships as a second analytic model beside the Diamond Model — a per-notebook hypotheses × evidence matrix scored by inconsistency, embedded into reports via a `[[ach:ID]]` token.
- **Knowledge layer (addressed — 2a + 2b).** Actor/malware/campaign `Tag` rows now carry a structured `aliases` list (search resolves any alias to the canonical entity — see §2a) **and** structured attribution (sponsor/country, motivation, first/last seen), with `/tags/{id}` promoted to a real entity profile page (§2b). The in-app relationship graph was retired; richer graph modelling belongs in a dedicated TIP.
- **Machine-readable interop** — **ATT&CK Navigator layer export is shipped** (backlog A: per-report + per-entity `.json` + a coverage heatmap), **STIX 2.1 report bundle export is shipped** for report/taxonomy SDOs, and **read-only TAXII serving is shipped** for the published-report collection with incremental pull filters. Richer STIX validation/enrichment and inbound TAXII/MISP pull remain.
- **Need-to-know foundation:** stakeholders still consume finished products only; audience groups now compartment published reports across direct reads, search, feeds and dissemination. Richer policy automation and portal administration remain follow-ups.

## Priority 1 — Analytic tradecraft rigour (ICD 203 / Analytic Standards) — ✅ **complete**

*The single biggest uplift for a finished-intelligence platform. Three sub-initiatives, each independently shippable — all now shipped.*

### 1a. Source reliability grading (Admiralty / NATO System) — ✅ **implemented**
- Shipped: `Source` carries reliability (`A-F`), credibility (`1-6`), grading origin, engine, rationale, warning, timestamp and optional pasted `content_md`. Auto grading is a fully offline `heuristic:v1` over source identity plus analyst-supplied summary/content, leaving credibility as `6` when readable claim content cannot be assessed. Analysts can manually override, clear, and regrade. Chips render in notebook sources, report citations, report source lists, and the FULL PDF source appendix.
- Implemented on `Source` ([models.py:298-313](src/iceberg/models.py#L298-L313)):
  - **`reliability`** — A–F (A *completely reliable* … E *unreliable*, F *cannot be judged*).
  - **`credibility`** — 1–6 (1 *confirmed* … 5 *improbable*, 6 *cannot be judged*).
- Surfaced as a compact **"B2"-style chip** in the notebook source list, the report citation list, and the **PDF source appendix** (`typst/product.typ`). Existing rows remain ungraded until manually graded or regraded.
- **Impact:** High / **Effort:** shipped. New enums + source columns + schema field ([schemas.py](src/iceberg/schemas.py)) + template/PDF chip.

### 1b. Estimative language — analytic confidence *and* likelihood — ✅ **implemented**
- ICD 203 requires two *separate* expressions: **analytic confidence** in the judgement, and the **likelihood/probability** of the event.
- Shipped: a Report-level optional **`analytic_confidence`** (`AnalyticConfidence` LOW/MODERATE/HIGH, nullable = "not stated") — stamped as a calm neutral marking on the report masthead beside TLP/status (web view `confidence_badge` macro + `product.typ`, all formats). Optional so analysts assert it deliberately rather than implying a confidence on every draft.
- Shipped: the **standardised probability yardstick** as an authoring aid — a controlled lexicon mapped to percentage bands (*almost no chance 01–05 · very unlikely 05–20 · unlikely 20–45 · roughly even chance 45–55 · likely 55–80 · very likely 80–95 · almost certain 95–99*), single-sourced in `help_content.py` (`PROBABILITY_YARDSTICK`) and shown as a collapsible reference panel in the editor + the `estimative-language` glossary entry. Likelihood stays prose (phrased via the yardstick), not a structured field.
- Shipped: the optional **tradecraft lint** flags vague hedging in live preview responses, surfacing warnings in the report editor without blocking saves.
- **Impact:** High / **Effort:** shipped.

### 1c. Structured judgement scaffolding (KJ / KA / Gaps) — ✅ **implemented**
> Shipped: `key_judgements` / `key_assumptions` / `intelligence_gaps` markdown fields on `Report`, editable in the report editor (publish-immutable), rendered as discrete sections in the web view and PDF; EXEC_BRIEF / ONE_PAGER are Key-Judgements-only. ACH is also shipped. Plan: [docs/plans/1c-judgement-scaffolding.md](docs/plans/1c-judgement-scaffolding.md).
- Promote **Key Judgements**, **Key Assumptions**, and **Intelligence Gaps** to first-class optional markdown fields on `Report` ([models.py:312-344](src/iceberg/models.py#L312-L344)), rendered as standard sections in the web view and PDF — and let the **EXEC_BRIEF / ONE_PAGER** formats render *just* the Key Judgements (this is what those formats are for).
- **Stretch — ✅ implemented:** **ACH** ships as a second analytic model alongside Diamond, reusing the exact `services/diamond.py` pattern (per-notebook `ACHModel` → server-rendered SVG matrix → `[[ach:ID]]` inline token in web view, live preview and Typst PDF). Hypotheses × evidence with a 5-point + N/A consistency scale (Heuer); the analytic payload is the per-hypothesis inconsistency score (least inconsistent = most tenable). Admin-free, writer-only, notebook-scoped; edited on an Alpine grid with a live preview. Migration `b232d8f39c4b`. See `services/ach.py`.
- **Impact:** Medium–High / **Effort:** shipped (Medium fields + Medium-Large ACH).

## Priority 2 — Knowledge graph / actor profiles — ✅ **complete**

*Move the actor/malware/campaign vocabulary from flat labels to a richer entity profile. Aliases and attribution shipped; the relationship-graph sub-initiative was retired after implementation.*

### 2a. Aliases (ship first — fixes the naming problem, cheap) — ✅ **implemented**
- Shipped: a structured **`aliases`** list (a JSON column) on ACTOR/MALWARE/CAMPAIGN tags (`tags.ALIASABLE_KINDS`) so APT28 / Fancy Bear / Sofacy / STRONTIUM resolve to one entity. Admin-curated in `/admin/tags` (comma-separated input, shown only for named-threat kinds); normalised case-insensitively with the canonical label dropped as an alias. Starter taxonomy backfilled (aliases lifted out of the description strings).
- Shipped: **search is alias-aware** ([services/search.py](src/iceberg/services/search.py)) — `tags.resolve_alias_report_ids` resolves a query against tag labels + aliases and appends the matching entity's reports after the bm25 body matches, so any alias matches the canonical entity even when the body never names it. Tag text is *not* denormalised into FTS (no `report_fts` DDL change); resolution is a query-time tag lookup. Aliases surface as "Also known as" on the `/tags/{id}` detail page.
- **Impact:** High / **Effort:** shipped (Low–Medium). New JSON column + service helpers + schema/API/admin-form threading + the search union + migration `c5c560ff65be`.

### 2b. Entity attribution profile — ✅ **implemented**
- Shipped: the named-threat tag kinds (`tags.ALIASABLE_KINDS`) carry structured attribution on `Tag` — `suspected_attribution` (free-text sponsor/country), `motivations` (a JSON list validated against a new `Motivation` enum: ESPIONAGE/FINANCIAL/HACKTIVISM/DESTRUCTIVE/INFLUENCE, multi-valued), and fuzzy free-text `first_seen`/`last_seen`. Admin-curated in `/admin/tags` (gated to named-threat kinds, like aliases) and seeded from `data/starter_tags.json` (starter ACTORs backfilled — attribution lifted out of the description gloss).
- Shipped: `/tags/{id}` now renders a dedicated **entity profile** (`templates/entity_profile.html`) for named-threat kinds — attribution panel + motivation chips + "Also known as" aliases + an ATT&CK link off `external_id` (G-/S-code) + the reports-tagged list. Other kinds keep the plain `search.html` drill-down. Migration `b3d9a4e21c7f`.
- **Impact:** Medium / **Effort:** shipped (Medium). New `Motivation` enum + four `Tag` columns + `normalise_motivations` + schema/API/admin-form threading + profile template + route split.

### 2c. Entity relationships (the graph) — retired
- This was intentionally removed after implementation. Iceberg should produce finished intelligence and export interoperable context, but a durable actor/malware/campaign relationship graph is better owned by a dedicated TIP/OpenCTI/MISP-class system. Current STIX export derives report and tag SDOs without maintaining in-app relationship edges.

> **Design note:** prefer *extending* the existing `Tag` model incrementally (aliases → attribution) over a disruptive new `Entity` model. TECHNIQUE/SECTOR/TOPIC stay as plain tags; only the "named-threat" kinds graduate to richer profiles. This keeps the report editor's tag-selection UX intact.

## Secondary backlog (not prioritised now — listed for completeness)

| # | FR | Opportunity | Why it matters | Impact / Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | [#28](../../issues/28) ✅ | **ATT&CK Navigator layer export + matrix view** — ✅ **implemented** | Emits a schema-conformant Navigator `.json` layer per report (techniques scored 1) and per named-threat entity (aggregated across its reports, scored by occurrence), plus a `/matrix` technique-coverage heatmap (global + per-entity) grouped by ATT&CK tactic. A **pure derivation** over existing `TECHNIQUE` tags (`Tag.external_id` for the T-code, `Tag.description` for the tactic) — no new model, no migration. Access-scoped like search (stakeholders → published only). See `services/attack.py`. *Open follow-up: an inline `[[attack]]` report embed ([#41](../../issues/41)).* | High / **Low** — shipped |
| B | [#29](../../issues/29) | **STIX 2.1 / TAXII interop** — partial ✅ | STIX 2.1 bundle export is shipped for a visible report plus report/taxonomy SDOs (threat actors, malware, campaigns, ATT&CK attack-patterns and sectors), and a read-only TAXII-shaped `published-reports` collection serves published objects with `added_after`, `limit`, `next`, `match[type]`, and `match[id]` pull filters. Relationship/SRO enrichment and stricter STIX validation remain follow-ups. | High / Medium — foundation shipped |
| C | [#30](../../issues/30) | **Dissemination channels + subscription matching** — partial ✅ | Publication webhooks support stable generic JSON plus opt-in Slack Block Kit and Microsoft Teams MessageCard envelopes; stakeholder tag-subscription matching and portal subscription management in Preferences are shipped. | Medium / Medium — foundation shipped |
| D | [#31](../../issues/31) ✅ | **Intelligence-cycle feedback loop** — ✅ **implemented** | Stakeholders leave feedback (usefulness + optional RFI-satisfaction verdict + comment) on products **disseminated to them**; a **Met** verdict from the owning stakeholder auto-advances their linked requirement to `SATISFIED` (closing the cycle). Feedback surfaces on the report view (writers) and requirement detail (analysts), and feeds new effectiveness metrics (response / satisfaction / useful rates) into the maturity dashboard. New `ProductFeedback` model (one migration). See `services/feedback.py`. | Medium / Medium — shipped |
| E | [#32](../../issues/32) | **PAP (Permissible Actions Protocol)** beside TLP | **Not planned.** The feature was closed as Won't Do because adoption does not justify additional classification/UI friction; reconsider only if ecosystem use changes. | — |
| F | [#33](../../issues/33) | **Need-to-know / compartmentation fix** — partial ✅ | Audience groups are shipped and enforced across report visibility, search, feed reads and dissemination, with admin group management and report-editor scoping. Raw notebook material was already writer-only; richer policy automation remains a follow-up. | High (security) / Medium — foundation shipped |
| G | [#42](../../issues/42) ✅ | **Intelligence-requirement kinds (PIR / GIR / RFI) + PIR coverage** — ✅ **implemented** | Splits requirements into doctrine kinds, adds PIR decision context/review-by scaffolding, board ordering and PIR gap/overdue coverage. | Medium / Medium — shipped |
| H | [#49](../../issues/49) ✅ | **CTI program maturity & effectiveness dashboard** — ✅ **implemented** | Writer-only `/maturity` view deriving program-health indicators — requirement coverage (extends `pir_coverage` to all kinds), production metrics, dissemination reach, tradecraft-adoption share — from existing data, plus an **indicative** [CTI-CMM](https://cti-cmm.org/)-style maturity rollup (four capability dimensions scored CTI0–CTI3 by thresholds, framed as evidence for a self-assessment, not a substitute). **Pure aggregation, no schema change** (`services/maturity.py`). Leadership-facing evidence; pairs with D once feedback exists. *Inspired by [zsazsa](https://github.com/cudeso/zsazsa).* | High / Medium — shipped |
| I | [#50](../../issues/50) | **Inbound collection — external feed ingestion into notebooks** — partial ✅ | RSS/Atom feed source management, bounded safe pulls, portal triage, discard and promote-to-notebook-source are shipped. TAXII/MISP pull, scheduling and relevance triage remain follow-ups. | High / Large — foundation shipped |

## Suggested sequencing

**Done:** ~~A (Navigator export)~~, ~~Priority 1 (1a/1b/1c incl. ACH + hedging lint)~~, ~~Priority 2 (2a/2b; 2c retired)~~, ~~G (requirement kinds)~~, ~~D (feedback loop)~~, ~~H (maturity dashboard)~~, plus foundations for ~~B~~, ~~C~~, ~~F~~ and ~~I~~ — all ✅ at the service/API layer noted above.

**What's next, in recommended order:**
1. **AI review workflow.** Audience groups, ingestion and tag subscriptions now have first-class portal workflows. The **first governed AI review UI has shipped** — AI-assisted IOC extraction (#95): the notebook Indicators section suggests candidate indicators from a source (refanged + `IOCType`-constrained), which the analyst accepts/edits/discards before promotion. The remaining UX gap is the same review/acceptance pattern for the report-editor suggestions (judgements, tags, challenge notes) and the feed-reader IOC surface.
2. **Richer STIX + inbound interop.** TAXII serving is useful now; validation tooling, richer external references, optional relationship/SRO enrichment, TAXII/MISP pull, and full ATT&CK import are the interop follow-ups.

**Loose follow-ups:** full ATT&CK import, tag merge/rename tooling, durable background jobs for notifications, webhooks and RSS polling, and a semantic embedding backend for related reports.

## Validation approach (when these are built)

When each item is implemented, validate in the style of the existing suite (in-memory SQLite + dev-login, per CLAUDE.md *Testing*):
- **1a/1b/1c:** model/enum round-trip + schema validation tests; assert the grading chip / confidence marking / KJ sections appear in both the web view and a Typst **render smoke test** (skips when the binary is absent, like the current one).
- **2a:** regression test that an alias query returns the canonical entity's reports (extends `services/search.py` coverage).
- **B (STIX/TAXII export):** schema-conformant SDO output for a report + its tagged entities (validate against a STIX 2.1 validator or the library's own checks); TAXII manifest/object endpoints access-scoped like report reads, including incremental pull filter coverage.
- **G (requirement kinds):** kind round-trip (API + portal), PIR-first tasking-board ordering, and the PIR coverage/gap aggregation (uncovered + overdue + empty state), with unchanged ownership/role rules.
- **H (maturity dashboard):** ✅ done — `program_maturity` aggregation (production/coverage/dissemination/tradecraft counts + rates), the CTI-CMM `_level` band thresholds, empty-DB safety, writer-only route gating (stakeholder → 403), and the template render (`tests/test_maturity.py`).
- Update **CLAUDE.md** (domain model + roadmap) and **README.md** alongside any implementation, per the repo's maintenance rule.
